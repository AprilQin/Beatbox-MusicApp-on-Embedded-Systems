Beatbox Application:

This is a simple beatbox application with three rhythms. The application has a user interface written in nodejs, html & jquery.
The backend beatbox music app is written in C. It uses UDP protocol to communicate with the front end web user interface. 
When the backend application starts, it creates two threads. One thread for continuously playing the musical beats, another thread 
for listening to the front end user interface UDP messages.

This application was created and tested on Embedded system beaglebone. Joystick was used to control the application. 
Press in to change rhythm. Press up and down to adjust volumn. Press left and right to adjust the speed of the music.

To run this application (on beaglebone), do the following three steps.

1. run "make" to compile the backend C application
2. node server.js to start the frontend web user interface
3. go to localhost:3042 on browser
